## What it does

SURU turns a commodity firewall and a small Linux box into a layered security
monitoring stack. Network traffic is inspected at the perimeter, normalised to a
single schema, stored in a search engine, and surfaced through dashboards — all
on hardware you own, with data that never leaves your network unless you opt in.

- **Inline intrusion detection/prevention** at the perimeter (Suricata, ET Open + Talos rules).
- **Passive network telemetry** (Zeek) for DNS, DHCP, HTTP, TLS, connection and file visibility.
- **DNS/IP reputation blocking** (pfBlockerNG) with threat-feed aggregation.
- **Behavioural detection** via MITRE ATT&CK–mapped Sigma rules.
- **Centralised analytics** — every event normalised to **Elastic Common Schema (ECS) v8**,
  indexed in **OpenSearch**, browsable in **OpenSearch Dashboards**.
- **GeoIP / ASN enrichment** of public source/destination IPs (MaxMind GeoLite2).
- **Encrypted log transport** — mutual-TLS (mTLS) from the perimeter to the core,
  signed by a single platform Root CA.
- **Operations plane** — Prometheus + Grafana + Alertmanager monitoring and a single
  nginx **frontdoor** that is the only LAN entry point to the stack.

Everything is driven by idempotent, re-runnable shell scripts and Docker Compose —
no manual GUI clicking required to stand the platform up or tear it down.

## Architecture — four tiers, defence in depth

| Tier | Directory | Role | Key components |
|------|-----------|------|----------------|
| **T1 — Perimeter** | [`tier1-perimeter/`](./tier1-perimeter/) | First line of defence on the router | pfSense / OPNsense, Suricata IPS, Zeek NSM, syslog-ng mTLS forwarder |
| **T2 — Telemetry** | [`tier2-telemetry/`](./tier2-telemetry/) | Signature & behavioural detection content | ET Open + Talos rule selection, MITRE ATT&CK Sigma rules, pfBlockerNG feeds |
| **T3 — Core** | [`tier3-core/`](./tier3-core/) | Analytics, storage & detection | OpenSearch + Dashboards, Logstash ingest pipelines, ECS v8 normalisation, GeoIP enrichment |
| **T4 — Operations** | [`tier4-operations/`](./tier4-operations/) | Control plane | PKI (single Root CA), nginx frontdoor, Prometheus/Grafana/Alertmanager monitoring |

The tiers are independent and degrade gracefully: Tier 1 runs without the SIEM,
the SIEM runs without endpoint agents, and there is no single point of failure.
The four-tier layout is intentional and stable — new capabilities are added
**within** the matching tier so the structure stays predictable for operators and
contributors alike.

## Quick start

Full step-by-step instructions — prerequisites, environment variables, and
per-tier verification — are in **[INSTALL.md](./INSTALL.md)**.

The deployment order follows the defence-in-depth dependency chain:

```text
1. Certificates   →  generate the single SURU Root CA + service certs
2. Tier 3 (Core)  →  bring up OpenSearch, Dashboards, Logstash ingest
3. Tier 4 (Ops)   →  bring up the frontdoor + monitoring
4. Tier 1 (Edge)  →  push config + mTLS client cert to the router
```

```bash
# 1. Certificates (single Root CA — run once)
bash tier4-operations/pki/scripts/generate-certs.sh --verbose

# 2. Tier 3 — Core analytics stack
bash tier3-core/scripts/deploy.sh deploy --verbose
bash tier3-core/scripts/deploy.sh check

# 3. Tier 4 — Frontdoor + monitoring
bash tier4-operations/scripts/deploy.sh deploy --verbose
bash tier4-operations/scripts/deploy.sh check

# 4. Tier 1 — Perimeter (run from tier1-perimeter/)
make -C tier1-perimeter deploy-full PLATFORM=pfsense VERBOSE=true
```

---

## Requirements

- A **pfSense** or **OPNsense** firewall (the perimeter you already run).
- A small always-on **Linux host** for the core (Docker + Compose v2; 8 GB RAM
  minimum, 16 GB recommended; ~50 GB disk for index data).
- `bash`, `docker`, `openssl`, `make`, and SSH access to the router.

- **Logs:** every source normalised to **ECS v8**.
- **Detection content:** annotated with MITRE ATT&CK Tactic (`TA####`) + Technique (`T####`).
- **TLS everywhere:** minimum TLS 1.2, prefer 1.3; mTLS for service-to-service log shipping.
- **Containers:** non-root, `cap_drop: [ALL]`, `no-new-privileges`, pinned images, never mount the Docker socket.
